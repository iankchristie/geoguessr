This compiles, but I haven't done a real training, so I don't know if it works.

Data is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ubitquitin/geolocation-geoguessr-images-50k
You'll also need to download a resnet18 model. Pytorch pointed me to one, so maybe it will point you also. Or you can ask me and I can send it to you. It's too big to check into github.
